# 🚀 24/7 Continuous Autonomous Operation Guide

## Overview

This system is now configured for **continuous 24/7 autonomous operation** with:
- ✅ **No exit codes** - Bots restart instead of exiting
- ✅ **Auto-reconnection** - Automatic reconnection on any disconnection
- ✅ **Continuous schedules** - No cron-based schedules, always running
- ✅ **Bot-to-bot sync** - All bots maintain connections with each other
- ✅ **Zero downtime** - Automatic recovery and restart mechanisms
- ✅ **Autonomous prompts** - Bots receive instructions to operate fully autonomously

## Configuration

### Environment Variables for 24/7 Operation

```bash
# Enable continuous mode (DEFAULT: true)
CONTINUOUS_MODE=true

# Enable auto-reconnect (DEFAULT: true)
AUTO_RECONNECT=true

# Auto-start all services (DEFAULT: true)
AUTO_START=true

# Enable all bot features
FREELANCE_ENABLED=true
AI_ENABLED=true

# Faster health checks for continuous monitoring (30 seconds)
HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=30000

# Reconnect interval (5 seconds)
RECONNECT_INTERVAL=5000
```

### Bot Configuration

All bots are now configured with autonomous defaults:

1. **Auto-start**: Enabled by default
2. **Continuous Mode**: Runs indefinitely, restarts on errors
3. **Auto-reconnect**: Reconnects to other bots every 5 seconds
4. **No Exit Codes**: ShutdownHandler doesn't exit in continuous mode
5. **Health Monitoring**: 30-second interval checks

## Startup

### Local Development (24/7 Mode)

```bash
# Set up environment with continuous mode
cp .env.example .env

# Start bot in continuous mode
CONTINUOUS_MODE=true AUTO_START=true node bot.js
```

### Production Deployment

For true 24/7 operation, deploy to a platform that supports continuous processes:

#### Option 1: Railway
```bash
# Deploy with environment variables
railway up
# Set CONTINUOUS_MODE=true in Railway dashboard
```

#### Option 2: Heroku
```bash
# Deploy with Procfile
web: CONTINUOUS_MODE=true node bot.js
```

#### Option 3: PM2 (Process Manager)
```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start in continuous mode
pm2 start bot.js --name "quantum-bot" \
  --env CONTINUOUS_MODE=true \
  --env AUTO_START=true \
  --env AUTO_RECONNECT=true

# Enable startup on boot
pm2 startup
pm2 save

# Monitor
pm2 monit
```

#### Option 4: Docker with Auto-restart
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t quantum-bot .

# Run with restart policy
docker run -d \
  --name quantum-bot \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e CONTINUOUS_MODE=true \
  -e AUTO_START=true \
  -e AUTO_RECONNECT=true \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  quantum-bot
```

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

The bot performs health checks every 30 seconds:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Uptime
- Connection status

Access health status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/health
```

### Status Monitoring

Check bot status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/status
```

This returns:
- Trading status
- Freelance status
- AI processing status
- Bot connections
- Reconnection attempts
- Uptime

### Logs

Monitor logs in continuous mode:
```bash
# Using PM2
pm2 logs quantum-bot

# Using Docker
docker logs -f quantum-bot

# Direct
tail -f logs/bot-errors.log
```

## Autonomous Prompt

When the bot starts, it receives this autonomous prompt:

```
🚀 AUTONOMOUS PROMPT: You are now operating in fully autonomous mode.
   Your task is to continuously:
   • Monitor markets and execute trades autonomously
   • Process freelance tasks without manual intervention
   • Maintain AI task processing queue
   • Keep connections alive with all other bots
   • Auto-reconnect on any disconnection (NO DOWNTIME)
   • Operate 24/7 with continuous health monitoring
```

## Bot-to-Bot Coordination

All bots maintain connections with each other:

1. **Sync Interval**: 5 seconds
2. **Auto-reconnect**: Automatic on disconnection
3. **Status Sharing**: Bots share their status
4. **Zero Downtime**: Continuous connection attempts

### How It Works

- Each bot runs `maintainBotConnections()` every 5 seconds
- If a connection is lost, automatic reconnection is attempted
- Bots track connected peers in `botState.continuous.botConnections`
- Reconnection attempts are logged and monitored

## Workflow Changes

GitHub Actions workflows no longer run on schedules:

### Before (Scheduled)
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM
```

### After (Continuous)
```yaml
on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  # No schedule - bots run continuously on infrastructure
```

## Safety Features

Even in continuous mode, safety is maintained:

1. **Kill Switch**: Can still stop operations via `/kill-switch` endpoint
2. **Paper Trading Default**: Trading mode defaults to 'paper'
3. **Auto-execute Off**: Freelance auto-execute requires explicit enable
4. **Error Handling**: Errors trigger recovery, not termination
5. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent runaway operations

## Emergency Stop

To stop continuous operation (if needed):

### Via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/kill-switch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"activate": true, "reason": "Emergency stop"}'
```

### Via Process Manager
```bash
# PM2
pm2 stop quantum-bot

# Docker
docker stop quantum-bot

# Direct
kill <PID>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Keeps Restarting
- Check logs for errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check kill switch status

### Connections Not Maintained
- Verify `AUTO_RECONNECT=true`
- Check `RECONNECT_INTERVAL` setting
- Review network connectivity

### High CPU/Memory Usage
- Adjust `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` to longer interval
- Reduce `RECONNECT_INTERVAL` frequency
- Check for memory leaks in logs

## Benefits of Continuous Operation

1. **No Downtime**: Bots always running, always connected
2. **Automatic Recovery**: Errors don't stop the system
3. **24/7 Monitoring**: Markets and tasks continuously monitored
4. **Bot Coordination**: All bots stay synchronized
5. **Autonomous**: No manual intervention required

## Migration from Scheduled to Continuous

If migrating from scheduled operation:

1. **IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGES:**
   - `AUTO_START` now defaults to `true` (was `false`) - Set explicitly to `false` if you don't want auto-start
   - `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` now in **milliseconds** (was seconds) - Update existing values by multiplying by 1000
   - `FREELANCE_ENABLED`, `AI_ENABLED` now default to `true` (were `false`) - Disable explicitly if not needed

2. Update environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Enable continuous mode
   CONTINUOUS_MODE=true
   
   # Control auto-start (now defaults to true)
   AUTO_START=true  # or false to disable
   
   # Enable auto-reconnect
   AUTO_RECONNECT=true
   
   # Update health check interval (NOW IN MILLISECONDS!)
   HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=30000  # 30 seconds (NOT 30)
   ```

3. Review service defaults - all services now enabled by default:
   ```bash
   FREELANCE_ENABLED=true  # Now default
   AI_ENABLED=true         # Now default
   BOT_ENABLED=true        # Still default
   ```

4. Deploy to continuous infrastructure (PM2, Docker, Railway, etc.)

5. Monitor for 24-48 hours to ensure stability

6. Remove any external cron jobs or scheduled tasks

## Summary

The system now operates in **fully autonomous 24/7 mode** with:
- ✅ Continuous operation (no exit codes)
- ✅ Auto-reconnection (no downtime)
- ✅ Bot synchronization (all bots connected)
- ✅ Autonomous prompts (clear instructions)
- ✅ Health monitoring (continuous checks)
- ✅ Error recovery (automatic restart)

**All bots are now autonomous, always connected, and operating 24/7.**
